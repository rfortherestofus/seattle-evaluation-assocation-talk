## How I Learned R

???

- The fact that there are so many ways to do anything in R is both a blessing and curse for newbies
- I remember a period of several months where I would do some reading or tutorials about R and then try to work on a project. I think there were at least five projects that I started in R, got to a point where I couldn’t do something, and had to go back to Excel. It was super frustrating!

# What is Data Science Exactly?

???

Have people give ideas about what data science is

- Sexy field today, both for orgs and individuals
- Branding exercise to get more cache + $
- But if we only think of it as the stats part, we're missing a whole side of what data scientists do

# What Can Data Science Teach Evaluation?

## Lesson #1<br>Make your work transparent<br>to catch mistakes<br>before it’s too late

???

- We all make mistakes. Question is just whether we see them before we send out results. 
- Give example of ODS project when I kept having to redownload data and didn't know how I had merged it.
- Code is just a written out version of your work process. Anyone should be able to read it and know what you did.

## Lesson #2<br>Think about the<br>structure of your data up front<br>to get better results on the back end

???

- Common for data scientists to complain about messy data
- As evaluators, we have advantage of collecting data
- Don't separate out data colletion and analysis stages in your planning
- Do things like use validation in forms to ensure you get data you can use

## Lesson #3<br>Automate all the things!

<!-- ![](images/automate-all-the-things.jpg) -->

???

- If you know the structure of data, you can analyze it automatically
- You can automate data cleaning, analysis, and reporting (i.e. not just reporting)
- You can do this in Excel as well (give example of Reading Partners)
- Give example of how I produced report automatically for webinar
- You then have more time to think about what the data *means*

## Lesson #4<br>R is a Workflow Tool

???

- Sharla's example
- R isn't just for complex statistical analyses. RMarkdown can improve your workflow tremendously.

# Don't Just Work *in* your Data<br>Also Work *on* Your Data

???

- From e-myth book
- Don't just analyze your data. Think also in meta ways about your data.

# A Little Bit of Code Goes a Long Way

> Learning R really doesn’t have to be about learning statistical models or advanced computation methods. I have a masters degree in Statistics and the most statistical thing I do these days is calculate a median.

- Never Having to redo report with mistake in it: priceless
- Learning how to code is not just about doing stats, it's also about workflow
