## Talk Description

Evaluation and data science share much in common. At their core, both are designed to help people use data to improve decision making. Despite these similarities, there are some major differences. And there are some key insights that those of us in evaluation can take from data science.

When I started learning R three years ago, I found myself part of the world of data science (many R users come from this field). So, like the anthropologist I was originally trained to be, I started taking notes. 

In this talk, I will open up my field notebook to present some lessons I've learned over the past three years. In particular, I will discuss how working *on* our data — not just working *in* our data — can enable evaluators to be more efficient and, ultimately, more effective.
